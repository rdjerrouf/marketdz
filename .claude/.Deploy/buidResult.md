I ran the errors with ai studio by google and here is what it says:

Of course. I can tell you exactly why the deployment failed. This is a very common scenario, and the log gives us a perfect trail of breadcrumbs to the root cause.
Let's break it down.
The Short Answer: The Root Cause
Your deployment failed because of a single, critical TypeScript error that stopped the build process cold.
File: ./src/app/api/reviews/[id]/route_fixed.ts
Error: Type error: Module '"@/lib/supabase/server"' has no exported member 'supabase'.
The rest of the log—all those hundreds of lines of warnings—are just noise. They are things you should clean up later, but they did not cause the failure. This one error is the showstopper.
Detailed Analysis: What This Error Means
The error message is very specific. In your file route_fixed.ts, you have a line that looks like this:
code
TypeScript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
This line tells your code: "Go into the file /src/lib/supabase/server.ts and find a variable or function named supabase that has been explicitly exported, and bring it here for me to use."
The build is failing because it went to that file and could not find an export for a variable named supabase.
This almost always happens for one of two reasons:
It's a Default Export, Not a Named Export: The file /src/lib/supabase/server.ts might be exporting the client as a default export, like export default createClient(...). If that's the case, your import statement is wrong.
The Export Has a Different Name or Doesn't Exist: You might have named the exported client something else (e.g., export const serverSupabase = ...), or you forgot to add the export keyword entirely.
Your Action Plan: How to Fix It in 3 Steps
This should be a quick fix.
Step 1: Inspect the "Server" Supabase Client File
Open this file in your code editor:
./src/lib/supabase/server.ts
Look at the very last line. How are you exporting the Supabase client?
Does it look like this? (Named Export)
code
TypeScript
export const supabase = createClient(...)
Or does it look like this? (Default Export)
code
TypeScript
const supabase = createClient(...)
export default supabase
Step 2: Correct the Import in the Failing File
Now go to the file that the error log pointed to:
./src/app/api/reviews/[id]/route_fixed.ts
Find the import line and fix it based on what you found in Step 1:
If server.ts uses a Named Export (export const supabase), your import is correct, which means the export in server.ts is likely missing or misspelled. Make sure it's export const supabase.
If server.ts uses a Default Export (export default supabase), you must change the import to this:
code
TypeScript
// Change this:
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

// To this (remove the curly braces):
import supabase from '@/lib/supabase/server'
Step 3: Investigate the _fixed.ts Filename
Notice the filename: route_fixed.ts. This is unusual for Next.js, which expects API routes to be named route.ts.
This suggests you might have duplicated a file to try and fix something, and this "fixed" version has the error. Make sure this is the file that should actually be there. If you also have a route.ts in the same folder, you may have a conflict or be editing the wrong file.
What About All Those Warnings? (Technical Debt)
You have a lot of linting warnings. It's important to understand what they are so you aren't distracted by them.
@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars: You've declared variables but never used them. Safe to delete.
@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: You're using the any type, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript. You should try to define proper types.
react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: Your useEffect or useCallback hooks are missing dependencies. This can cause bugs where the hook doesn't re-run when it should.
@next/next/no-img-element: You're using the standard <img> tag instead of Next.js's <Image> component, which can lead to worse performance.
Deprecated Packages: The log correctly warns you that @supabase/auth-helpers-* are deprecated and you should plan to migrate to the new @supabase/ssr package in the future.
Action: You should absolutely clean these up for better code quality, but fix the critical build error first. Commit and push the fix, confirm your deployment succeeds, and then create a separate task to clean up these warnings.
