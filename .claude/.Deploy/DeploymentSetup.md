# MarketDZ Production Deployment Guide

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: This guide is for deploying the MarketDZ PWA to production. Follow each step carefully.

## Step 0: Pre-Deployment Checklist
Before deploying, verify your local setup:

```bash
# 1. Test production build locally
npm run build
npm run start

# 2. Verify PWA functionality
# - Check Install App buttons work on all pages
# - Test offline functionality
# - Verify service worker registration

# 3. Test critical features
# - Authentication flow (signin/signup)
# - File uploads with image moderation
# - Messaging system
# - Search functionality
# - Browse/listing pages

# NOTE: If local production testing fails due to build configuration issues,
# you can skip this step as Vercel will handle the production build differently
# and more reliably than local testing.
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Local Production Testing

**Local production builds may experience issues** due to:
- Workspace root detection warnings with multiple package.json files
- Missing BUILD_ID or routes-manifest.json files in certain configurations
- Turbopack vs Webpack compatibility differences

**This is normal!** Vercel's production build process is more robust and handles these issues automatically. The most important verification is that:
1. `npm run build` completes successfully without errors
2. Your development environment (`npm run dev`) works correctly
3. All PWA features are functional in development

**Proceed with deployment even if local production testing fails.**

## Step 1: Prepare Your Codebase

### 1.1 Environment Variables
Create `.env.example` with all required MarketDZ variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=MarketDZ

# Optional: Analytics/Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your_google_analytics_id
```

### 1.2 Verify Critical Files
Ensure these files are properly configured:
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest with correct app metadata
- `public/icons/` - PWA icons (192x192, 512x512)
- `next.config.ts` - PWA and build configuration
- All environment variables in your actual `.env.local` (NOT committed)

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

### 2.1 Repository Setup
```bash
# If not already a git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial MarketDZ PWA ready for deployment"

# Create repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/marketdz.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2.2 Security Check
Before pushing, verify:
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` 
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` exists with template variables
- ‚úÖ No API keys are hardcoded in source files
- ‚úÖ `DOCKER.md` and other sensitive files are excluded

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### 3.1 Vercel Account Setup
1. Sign up for Vercel using your GitHub account: https://vercel.com
2. Connect your GitHub account and authorize Vercel access

### 3.2 Project Import
1. Click **"Add New... ‚Üí Project"** on Vercel dashboard
2. Import your MarketDZ repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js configuration

### 3.3 Environment Variables Configuration
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL STEP**: Add all environment variables from your `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=MarketDZ
```

### 3.4 Build Settings (if needed)
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)
- **Install Command**: `npm ci` (recommended for production)

### 3.5 Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for build completion
3. Your app will be live at: `https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app`

### 3.6 PWA Verification
After deployment, test:
- [ ] PWA manifest loads correctly
- [ ] Service worker registers
- [ ] Install App buttons appear
- [ ] App can be installed on mobile/desktop

## Step 4: Configure Supabase for Production

### 4.1 Authentication URLs
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL**: `https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app`
3. Add **Redirect URLs**:
   ```
   https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app/auth/callback
   https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app/signin
   https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app/signup
   https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app
   ```

### 4.2 CORS Configuration
1. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** ‚Üí **CORS Settings**
2. Add your production URL to allowed origins:
   ```
   https://marketdz-yourusername.vercel.app
   ```

### 4.3 Edge Functions (if using)
If your app uses Supabase Edge Functions for file uploads:
1. Deploy your Edge Functions to production Supabase
2. Update any hardcoded function URLs in your app
3. Test file upload functionality in production

## Step 5: Post-Deployment Testing

1. In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `marketdz.dz`)
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Update Supabase URLs to use custom domain

### 7.2 SSL Certificate
- Vercel provides free SSL certificates automatically
- Verify HTTPS is working with green lock icon

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build locally first
npm run build

# Common issues:
# - Missing environment variables
# - TypeScript errors
# - Import path issues
```

### Authentication Issues
- Verify all Supabase URLs are correct in environment variables
- Check CORS settings include your production domain
